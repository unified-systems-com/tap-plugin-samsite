"""MAJOR KLUDGE (v0 demo) — blanket authorization-boundary membership.

Every ``aws_account`` node on the grid is auto-scoped into the samsite FedRAMP
authorization boundary via a ``SCOPED_TO_COMPLIANCE_BOUNDARY`` edge (account → boundary),
synthesized by the samsite compliance collector *after* the boto3 collector has
populated the account(s).

Why this exists
---------------
The boundary's real contract (``compliance_core`` ``ComplianceBoundary`` model) is that
*curated* components link to it via ``SCOPED_TO_COMPLIANCE_BOUNDARY`` and "what's in the
boundary" is a fan-in query over those edges. A correct boundary is a **subset**
— not every account in an org, and within an account not every resource is in
scope. This module deliberately ignores all of that and scopes in *every*
account, because for the single-account, everything-is-samsite demo it's right
enough and it's the fastest path to a real, queryable membership relationship.

Why here and not elsewhere
--------------------------
- NOT in the GRIFT seed: the account is collector-owned and does not exist at
  seed time, so a hardcoded edge to it dangles on a clean boot (the bug this
  replaces).
- NOT in ``compliance_core``: making the regime-agnostic boundary auto-include
  ``aws_account`` would bake an aws_core-specific assumption into a substrate
  plugin that must not know AWS exists (hermetic-plugins rule).
- HERE, in samsite: samsite is the integration plugin that legitimately depends
  on both aws_core (the account type) and compliance_core (the boundary type +
  edge), and already owns the boundary *instance*. The edges are minted after
  the accounts exist, so nothing dangles.

FUTURE SEAM (replace this whole module)
---------------------------------------
Replace blanket all-accounts membership with a curated declaration of which
account(s) / resources are actually in scope, the moment there is more than one
account or any out-of-scope resource. The ``kludge`` marker on every synthesized
edge's ``properties`` makes the demo-only edges machine-identifiable for that
migration.
