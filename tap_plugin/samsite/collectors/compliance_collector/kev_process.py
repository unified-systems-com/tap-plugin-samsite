"""The CISA KEV fetch process: the deploy workflow → KEV catalog edge.

The static end of this story — the CISA ``web_host`` and the KEV catalog
``web_document``, joined by ``HOSTED_BY`` — is seeded by
``grift/kev-fetch.grift.json``. This module owns the dynamic end: the
``FETCHES`` edge from the deploy ``github_workflow`` (the signer of every
``/.well-known/`` artifact) to that seeded KEV catalog.

The edge can't be seeded statically because the deploy workflow's entity id
derives from a GitHub-assigned numeric workflow id, unknowable at authoring
time. So, exactly like the Sigstore ``SIGNED_BY_IDENTITY`` edge, the collector
resolves the workflow via Gryphon and emits the edge only when it resolves —
graceful (omitted) otherwise. The KEV catalog target is resolved (not minted)
here too: the seed owns that node, so the collector never creates it; if the
seed has not run, ``FETCHES`` is omitted rather than dangling.

Spec: plugins/samsite/specs/spec-samsite-compliance-collector-v0.md
(req-samsite-collector-kev-fetch).
