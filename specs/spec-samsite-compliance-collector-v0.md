# Samsite Compliance Collector Specification

## Philosophy

The samsite demo's compliance machinery publishes a family of Sigstore-signed
artifacts to `/.well-known/` on the public website — `ksi-signal.json`,
`oscal-ssp.json`, `oscal-poam.json`, `vdr-report.json`, `iiw.csv`, each paired
with a `.bundle` (Fulcio cert + signature + Rekor inclusion proof). This spec
defines the **collector** that ingests them: a daily run that fetches the set
over HTTPS, verifies every signature, and lands the result on the grid.

This spec owns only the collector. **What the artifacts become on the grid —
the model catalog — is `spec-fedramp-20x-ksi-compliance-artifacts-v0.md`**, in
the `fedramp_20x_ksi` plugin. The split is deliberate: the KSI signal and the
VDR report are framework-domain formats (Sam's KSI signal is a proposed
cross-CSP standard), so their models belong with the FedRAMP-20x-KSI
vocabulary. The collector is deployment-specific — it fetches *samsite's*
particular URLs — so it belongs in the `samsite` plugin. Framework owns the
vocabulary; deployment owns the wiring; this mirrors `aws_core` owning the AWS
model vocabulary that the boto3 collector populates.

The collector is concrete and samsite-specific in v0. A **generic web
collector** — fetch-and-verify against any declarative URL set, reusable beyond
samsite — is the future archetype, named here as a seam, not built. The samsite
collector is its first proving instance.

## Goals

|   |   |   |
| :---: | --- | --- |
| 1. | One Run, Whole Set | A single scheduled run fetches every `.well-known/` artifact, verifies each, and submits one GRIFT batch. |
| 2. | Verify Every Signature | Each artifact is checked against its Sigstore `.bundle`; the verification result lands on the node. |
| 3. | Decompose Via The Framework Spec | The collector decomposes the KSI signal and VDR into the `fedramp_20x_ksi` models; it does not define its own model shapes. |
| 4. | Declarative Manifest | The URL set and per-artifact handling are data, not code. |
| 5. | Daily, Reusing Existing Infrastructure | Runs daily on the `tap_cares` scheduler; adds no collector or scheduler framework. |
| 6. | Concrete Now, Generic Later | v0 is the samsite collector; the reusable generic web collector is a named future seam. |

### The Collector
----
RID: `req-samsite-collector`
Status: `Proposed`

A `CollectorBase` subclass in the `samsite` plugin. Unlike the boto3 collector
it needs no cloud credentials — it fetches public artifacts over HTTPS. One run
grabs the entire `.well-known/` set, verifies each, decomposes per
`req-samsite-collector-decompose`, and submits one GRIFT batch.

It reuses the `tap_cares` collector runtime end to end: registration, run
records, the GRIFT submission boundary, and the abort-on-rejection default. It
is a second `CollectorBase` implementation alongside the boto3 one, not a new
framework. A per-artifact fetch or verification failure is recorded as a
structured `warn`/`error`, never silently dropped; the run still collects the
artifacts that succeeded.

#### Acceptance Criteria

| ACID | Title | Status | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| req-samsite-collector-1 | CollectorBase Subclass | Proposed | The collector subclasses `CollectorBase` and uses the standard `tap_cares` runtime. | |
| req-samsite-collector-2 | One Run, Whole Set | Proposed | A single run fetches every artifact in the manifest. | |
| req-samsite-collector-3 | No Cloud Credentials | Proposed | The collector fetches public HTTPS URLs; it requires no AWS or other cloud credentials. | |
| req-samsite-collector-4 | GRIFT Submission | Proposed | The run produces one GRIFT batch via `CollectorBase.submit_grift`; partial failures are recorded, not dropped. | |

### Artifact Manifest
----
RID: `req-samsite-collector-manifest`
Status: `Proposed`

The set of URLs to fetch and how to handle each is **declarative data, not
code** — a JSON manifest of `{url, kind, handling}` entries, validated by a
JSON Schema authored in the same change. `handling` selects the decomposition
path: `ksi_signal`, `vdr_report`, or `compliance_artifact` (blob). This is the
same declarative-shapes discipline as the boto3 collector's resource manifest —
an agent reads the manifest and knows what the collector fetches without
reading collector code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

| ACID | Title | Status | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| req-samsite-collector-manifest-1 | Declarative URL Set | Proposed | The fetch targets live in a JSON manifest, not hardcoded in the collector. | |
| req-samsite-collector-manifest-2 | Schema-Validated | Proposed | The manifest ships a JSON Schema and is validated at load — fail loud on invalid. | |

### Signature Verification
----
RID: `req-samsite-collector-verify`
Status: `Implemented`

Every artifact ships a paired `.bundle` (Sigstore keyless: Fulcio cert +
signature + Rekor inclusion proof). The collector verifies each artifact
through **`sigstore_core`** — the canonical TAP-side verifier — calling
`sigstore_core.verify.verify_bundle`, never importing `sigstore.*` directly
(the original inline `compliance_collector/verify.py` was removed when this
plugin became sigstore_core's first consumer; see `req-sigstore-core-verify-8`).

Each verified bundle is decomposed via `sigstore_core.decompose.bundle_to_grift_fragment`
into the transparency-log graph — a `rekor_log_entry` node, a `sigstore_ca`
upsert, and `ATTESTED_BY` / `CERT_ISSUED_BY` edges — merged into the same
batch. The collector resolves the signing `github_workflow` from the cert SAN
(`(full_name, path)` via a Gryphon read, `sigstore_link.resolve_workflow_entity_id`)
and, on a single match, supplies it so a `SIGNED_BY_IDENTITY` edge is emitted.
It also ensures the `oidc_issuer` convergence node (github_core-owned) is in
the batch and supplies its id so the hotlinked `IDENTITY_VOUCHED_BY` edge has a
present target — the rekor entry's `signing_identity_issuer` field and that
edge are validated together in the one batch (deferred hotlink consistency).
The verification verdict is the absolute fact on the `ATTESTED_BY` edge per
`req-sigstore-core-disclosure`. (The artifact nodes retain their own
`signature_verified` / `signed_by` / `rekor_log_index` fields for now; folding
them onto the edge as the single source of truth is a follow-up that also
touches the consumer disclosure panels.)

A failed or unverifiable signature is recorded as `signature_verified =
false`/`null` — never silently dropped — and does not abort the run; an
unverified artifact is still collected, flagged, and (when the bundle parsed)
still emits its `ATTESTED_BY` edge with the false verdict.

**Scope line.** v0 verification is *bounded evaluation* — signature checking,
Rekor inclusion-proof checking, JSON-Schema validation, parsing. It does not
run fetched content as code. Arbitrary code-against-fetched-content is the
sandbox/satellite concern and is out of scope.

#### Acceptance Criteria

| ACID | Title | Status | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| req-samsite-collector-verify-1 | Bundles Verified | Implemented | Each artifact is verified against its `.bundle` via `sigstore_core.verify_bundle` (not `sigstore.*` directly); the result is recorded. | |
| req-samsite-collector-verify-2 | Failure Is Visible, Not Fatal | Implemented | A failed/unverifiable signature is recorded as such; the artifact still collects; the run does not abort. | |
| req-samsite-collector-verify-3 | Bounded Evaluation Only | Implemented | v0 verification is signature/proof/schema checking and parsing — never executing fetched content as code. | |
| req-samsite-collector-verify-4 | Signature Graph Emitted | Implemented | Each verified bundle is decomposed via `sigstore_core.bundle_to_grift_fragment` into a `rekor_log_entry` + `sigstore_ca` + `ATTESTED_BY`/`CERT_ISSUED_BY`, merged into the batch; `SIGNED_BY_IDENTITY` is added when the signing `github_workflow` resolves to a single node via Gryphon; the `oidc_issuer` node is ensured in-batch and the hotlinked `IDENTITY_VOUCHED_BY` edge emitted. | Cross-plugin workflow *read* + oidc_issuer ensure-exists are the consumer's job per `req-sigstore-core-edges-5`/`-7`. |

### Decomposition
----
RID: `req-samsite-collector-decompose`
Status: `Proposed`

The collector does not define model shapes — it produces nodes and edges per
`spec-fedramp-20x-ksi-compliance-artifacts-v0.md`:

- `ksi-signal.json` → a `ksi_signal` node, one `ksi_component` per
  `components[]`, one `ksi_validation` per `validations[]`, one `ksi_violation`
  per `violations[]`, and the `DECLARES_COMPONENT` / `DECLARES_VALIDATION` /
  `EVALUATES_COMPONENT` / `REPORTS_VIOLATION` edges.
- `vdr-report.json` → a `vdr_report` node, one `vdr_finding` per `findings[]`
  and `risk_accepted[]`, and the `REPORTS_FINDING` / `AFFECTS_RESOURCE` /
  `REFERENCES_SIGNAL` edges.
- `oscal-ssp.json`, `oscal-poam.json`, `iiw.csv` → one `compliance_artifact`
  blob node each.

#### Acceptance Criteria

| ACID | Title | Status | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| req-samsite-collector-decompose-1 | Framework Spec Owns Shapes | Proposed | The collector emits the `fedramp_20x_ksi` models; it defines no model shapes of its own. | |
| req-samsite-collector-decompose-2 | Signal And VDR Decomposed | Proposed | The KSI signal and VDR report are decomposed into their respective node/edge sets. | |
| req-samsite-collector-decompose-3 | Renderings Blobbed | Proposed | OSCAL SSP/POA&M and IIW each become one `compliance_artifact` node. | |

### Daily Schedule
----
RID: `req-samsite-collector-schedule`
Status: `Proposed`

The collector is registered to run on a daily schedule through the existing
`tap_cares` scheduler. Each run is one emission observation. The schedule is
collector configuration, not new scheduling infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

| ACID | Title | Status | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| req-samsite-collector-schedule-1 | Daily Cadence | Proposed | The collector is registered with a daily schedule via the `tap_cares` scheduler. | |
| req-samsite-collector-schedule-2 | No New Scheduler | Proposed | Scheduling reuses the existing scheduler; the collector adds no scheduling machinery. | |

### Identity And Emission History
----
RID: `req-samsite-collector-identity`
Status: `Proposed`

Deterministic identity, so re-runs upsert:

- `ksi_signal` — keyed by `signal_id`. Per-emission.
- `ksi_validation` — keyed by `signal_id` + `validation_id`. Per-emission.
- `ksi_violation` — keyed by `signal_id` + `validation_id` + a per-violation
  discriminator. Per-emission.
- `ksi_component` — keyed by `component_id`. The KSI schema states
  `component_id` is "stable across emissions where possible," so component
  nodes **deduplicate across emissions** — upserted, not re-created.
- `vdr_report` — keyed by `report_id`. Per-emission.
- `vdr_finding` — keyed by `report_id` + `tracking_id`. Per-emission. (A
  finding's `tracking_id` is stable across reports; the per-report key keeps
  each emission's evaluation distinct, which is the point — SLA clocks move.)
- `compliance_artifact` — keyed by `kind` + a per-emission discriminator.

Consequence, intentional: `ksi_component` nodes form a stable spine the daily
signal/validation/report emissions hang off, building an emission history.
Retention/pruning of old emissions is not a v0 concern — flagged for the
history system when emission volume warrants it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

| ACID | Title | Status | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| req-samsite-collector-identity-1 | Deterministic Identity | Proposed | Every node has a deterministic id so re-runs upsert rather than duplicate. | |
| req-samsite-collector-identity-2 | Components Dedup | Proposed | `ksi_component` nodes dedup across emissions by `component_id`. | |
| req-samsite-collector-identity-3 | Emissions Are Per-Run | Proposed | Signal, validation, violation, report, and finding nodes are per-emission; daily runs accumulate history. | |

### Authorization Boundary Membership (v0 KLUDGE)
----
RID: `req-samsite-collector-boundary-membership`
Status: `Proposed`

> ⚠️ **This requirement is a deliberate, documented KLUDGE for the sam demo.**
> It is correct *only* for the single-account, everything-is-in-scope demo and
> must be replaced before any multi-account or partial-scope deployment.

After decomposition, the collector synthesizes one `SCOPED_TO_COMPLIANCE_BOUNDARY` edge
(`aws_account` → boundary) for **every** `aws_account` node currently on the
grid, scoping them all into the samsite FedRAMP authorization boundary (the
boundary instance seeded by `plugins/samsite/grift/landing.grift.json`, owned by
the `fedramp_20x_ksi` `Boundary` model). The account ids are discovered with a
Gryphon read (`MATCH (a:aws_account) RETURN a`); edges are emitted in the same
GRIFT batch the collector already submits.

**Why a kludge.** A real authorization boundary is a *curated subset* — not
every account in an organization, and within an account not every resource is in
scope. Blanket all-accounts membership is intentionally over-broad; it buys a
real, queryable boundary-membership relationship (the `Boundary` model's fan-in
"what's in scope" query works, and the landing projection's boundary frame draws
from real edges) at near-zero cost for a demo where there is exactly one account
and it is entirely in scope.

**Why the collector, and why not the seed or `fedramp_20x_ksi`.**
- Not the GRIFT seed: the account is collector-owned and does not exist at seed
  time, so a hardcoded edge to it dangles on a clean boot (the defect this
  replaces).
- Not `fedramp_20x_ksi`: auto-including `aws_account` in the *generic* FedRAMP
  boundary would bake an aws_core-specific assumption into a plugin that must not
  know AWS exists (hermetic-plugins rule).
- The collector (in `samsite`, the integration plugin that depends on both
  aws_core and fedramp_20x_ksi and owns the boundary instance) mints the edges
  *after* the accounts exist, so nothing dangles. This is a first-class,
  spec-stated cross-plugin dependency, not a coincidental one.

**Disclosure + future seam.** Every synthesized edge carries
`properties.kludge = "all-aws-accounts-auto-in-boundary-v0"` so the demo-only
edges are machine-identifiable. Replace this requirement with a curated
membership declaration (which account(s)/resources are actually in scope) the
moment there is more than one account or any out-of-scope resource. Code:
`plugins/samsite/collectors/compliance_collector/boundary_membership.py`.

#### Acceptance Criteria

| ACID | Title | Status | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| req-samsite-collector-boundary-membership-1 | One Edge Per Account | Proposed | After decomposition the collector emits exactly one `SCOPED_TO_COMPLIANCE_BOUNDARY` edge from each `aws_account` on the grid to the samsite boundary. | |
| req-samsite-collector-boundary-membership-2 | Idempotent | Proposed | Edge ids are deterministic (`uuid5` over `SCOPED_TO_COMPLIANCE_BOUNDARY:<account>-><boundary>`); re-runs upsert rather than duplicate. | |
| req-samsite-collector-boundary-membership-3 | Graceful When Empty | Proposed | With no `aws_account` on the grid (fresh boot before the boto3 collector) the collector synthesizes zero edges and does not error. | |
| req-samsite-collector-boundary-membership-4 | Machine-Readable Kludge Marker | Proposed | Each synthesized edge carries `properties.kludge = "all-aws-accounts-auto-in-boundary-v0"`. | |

### CISA KEV Fetch Process
----
RID: `req-samsite-collector-kev-fetch`
Status: `Proposed`

The samsite deploy pipeline fetches the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities
(KEV) catalog from `cisa.gov` on every run, as the KEV gate input to the VDR
report (BOD 22-01). TAP models this fetch as a graph story spanning a seeded
static end and a collector-resolved dynamic end.

#### Implementation

The story is three nodes and two edges:

```
github_workflow (deploy) ─FETCHES─▶ web_document (CISA KEV catalog) ─HOSTED_BY─▶ web_host (CISA)
```

- **Static end (seed).** `grift/kev-fetch.grift.json` seeds the `web_host`
  (`cisa.gov`), the `web_document` (the KEV catalog URL), and the `HOSTED_BY`
  edge between them. Both endpoints are seeded together, so `HOSTED_BY` is
  always safe. The two nodes use `computing_core`'s web-native types and carry
  the `tap.web: native` marker. Ids are `uuid5` over the compliance collector's
  frozen namespace (`node_entity_id`/`edge_entity_id`), so the seed and the
  collector agree on the catalog's identity.
- **Dynamic end (collector).** The `FETCHES` edge cannot be seeded: the deploy
  `github_workflow`'s id derives from a GitHub-assigned numeric workflow id,
  unknowable at authoring time. The signer of every `/.well-known/` artifact is
  the deploy workflow, so the collector captures the workflow it already
  resolves for `SIGNED_BY_IDENTITY` and, in a dedicated phase, emits `FETCHES`
  from it to the seeded KEV catalog. Both ends are *resolved, never minted*: if
  the signing workflow didn't resolve, or the catalog isn't on the grid, the
  edge is omitted rather than dangled.
- **Board.** The samsite landing search adds explicit `MATCH (wh:web_host)` /
  `MATCH (wd:web_document)` (these types carry no per-model `tags` field, so the
  tag scan can't reach them), so the fetch story renders in the landing graph.

#### Acceptance Criteria

| ACID | Title | Status | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| req-samsite-collector-kev-fetch-1 | Static Nodes Seeded | Proposed | The CISA `web_host`, the KEV `web_document`, and their `HOSTED_BY` edge are seeded by `kev-fetch.grift.json`. | |
| req-samsite-collector-kev-fetch-2 | FETCHES From Deploy Workflow | Proposed | The collector emits a `FETCHES` edge from the resolved deploy `github_workflow` to the seeded KEV catalog. | Reuses the `SIGNED_BY_IDENTITY` workflow resolution. |
| req-samsite-collector-kev-fetch-3 | Resolved Not Minted | Proposed | The collector resolves both edge endpoints; it never mints the KEV catalog node. `FETCHES` is omitted (not dangled) when either endpoint is absent. | Mirrors `SIGNED_BY_IDENTITY` / boundary-membership graceful degradation. |
| req-samsite-collector-kev-fetch-4 | Idempotent | Proposed | The `FETCHES` edge id is deterministic (`uuid5` over `FETCHES:<workflow>-><catalog>`); re-runs upsert rather than duplicate. | |

### v0 Non-Goals
----
RID: `req-samsite-collector-nongoals`
Status: `Proposed`

- **Generic web collector.** v0 is the concrete samsite collector. A reusable
  fetch-and-verify web-collector engine — declarative URL set, generic
  verification, beyond samsite — is the future archetype. The samsite collector
  is its first proving instance; generalizing it waits for a second consumer.
- **Model shapes.** Owned entirely by `spec-fedramp-20x-ksi-compliance-artifacts-v0.md`;
  this spec never defines a node or edge shape.

#### Acceptance Criteria

| ACID | Title | Status | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| req-samsite-collector-nongoals-1 | Generic Collector Deferred | Proposed | The reusable generic web collector is named as a future seam, not built in v0. | |
